.SH CONFIGURATION

A very minimal configuration file may be used to tell shaman
some default values: a default location, and whether to use Imperial or Metric units by default. 
Shaman
will look for this config file in the following places in the following order, and will stop searching and load the first file it finds: 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/shaman/config,
$HOME/.config/shaman/config,
$HOME/.shamanrc
.PP
The config file should be formatted in the following way: 
.PP
Location=\fI"location"\fP
.br
Units="U" 
.PP
As with its command\-line argument counter\-part, \fI"location"\fP
may be formatted as either the zipcode or name. 
"U" may be either an "I" or an "M" (for Imperial and Metric respectively).
